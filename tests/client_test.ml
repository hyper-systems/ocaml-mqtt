(** Connect/Connack packet tests

    Tests on the mandatory normative statements on CONNECT/CONNACK packets which

    statements currently tested:

    MQTT 3.1.0-1: After a Network Connection is established by a Client to a
    Server, the first Packet sent from the Client to the Server MUST be a
    CONNECT Packet.

    MQTT 3.1.2-2: The Server MUST respond to the CONNECT Packet with a CONNACK
    return code 0x01 (unacceptable protocol level) and then disconnect the
    Client if the Protocol Level is not supported by the Server.

    MQTT 3.1.2-3: The Server MUST validate that the reserved flag in the CONNECT
    Control Packet is set to zero and disconnect the Client if it is not zero.

    MQTT 3.1.2-18: If the User Name Flag is set to 0, a user name MUST NOT be
    present in the payload.

    MQTT 3.1.2-20: If the Password Flag is set to 0, a password MUST NOT be
    present in the payload.

    MQTT 3.1.2-22: If the User Name Flag is set to 0, the Password Flag MUST be
    set to 0

    MQTT 3.1.3-3: The Client Identifier (ClientId) MUST be present and MUST be
    the first field in the CONNECT packet payload.

    MQTT 3.1.3-4: The ClientId MUST be a UTF-8 encoded string as defined in
    Section 1.5.3.

    MQTT 3.1.3-7: If the Client supplies a zero-byte ClientId, the Client MUST
    also set CleanSession to 1.

    MQTT 3.1.4-4: If CONNECT validation is successful the Server MUST
    acknowledge the CONNECT Packet with a CONNACK Packet containing a zero
    return code. *)

(** Publish packet tests

    Tests on the mandatory normative statements on PUBLISH/PUBACK/PUBREL/PUBREC/
    PUBREL/PUBCOMP packets which are meaningful on the client side. Here is a
    non-exhaustive list of the statements currently tested:

    MQTT 3.3.1-2: The DUP flag MUST be set to 0 for all QoS 0 messages.

    MQTT 3.3.2-1: The Topic Name MUST be present as the first field in the
    PUBLISH Packet Variable header. It MUST be a UTF-8 encoded string.

    MQTT 3.6.1-1: Bits 3,2,1 and 0 of the fixed header in the PUBREL Control
    Packet are reserved and MUST be set to 0,0,1 and 0 respectively. The Server
    MUST treat any other value as malformed and close the Network Connection.

    MQTT 4.3.1-1: In the QoS 0 delivery protocol, the Sender:

    - MUST send a PUBLISH packet with QoS=0, DUP=0.

    MQTT 4.3.2-1: In the QoS 1 delivery protocol, the Sender:

    - MUST assign an unused Packet Identifier each time it has a new Application
      Message to publish.
    - MUST send a PUBLISH Packet containing this Packet Identifier with QoS=1,
      DUP=0.
    - MUST treat the PUBLISH Packet as "unacknowledged" until it has received
      the corresponding PUBACK packet from the receiver. See Section 4.4 for a
      discussion of unacknowledged messages

    MQTT 4.3.2-2: In the QoS 1 delivery protocol, the Receiver:

    - MUST respond with a PUBACK Packet containing the Packet Identifier from
      the incoming PUBLISH Packet, having accepted ownership of the Application
      Message.
    - After it has sent a PUBACK Packet the Receiver MUST treat any incoming
      PUBLISH packet that contains the same Packet Identifier as being a new
      publication, irrespective of the setting of its DUP flag.

    MQTT 4.3.3-1: In the QoS 2 delivery protocol, the Sender:

    - MUST assign an unused Packet Identifier when it has a new Application
      Message to publish.
    - MUST send a PUBLISH packet containing this Packet Identifier with QoS=2,
      DUP=0.
    - MUST treat the PUBLISH packet as "unacknowledged" until it has received
      the corresponding PUBREC packet from the receiver. See Section 4.4 for a
      discussion of unacknowledged messages.
    - MUST send a PUBREL packet when it receives a PUBREC packet from the
      receiver. This PUBREL packet MUST contain the same Packet Identifier as
      the original PUBLISH packet.
    - MUST treat the PUBREL packet as "unacknowledged" until it has received the
      corresponding PUBCOMP packet from the receiver.
    - MUST NOT re-send the PUBLISH once it has sent the corresponding PUBREL
      packet

    MQTT 4.3.3-2: In the QoS 2 delivery protocol, the Receiver:

    - MUST respond with a PUBREC containing the Packet Identifier from the
      incoming PUBLISH Packet, having accepted ownership of the Application
      Message.
    - Until it has received the corresponding PUBREL packet, the Receiver MUST
      acknowledge any subsequent PUBLISH packet with the same Packet Identifier
      by sending a PUBREC. It MUST NOT cause duplicate messages to be delivered
      to any onward recipients in this case.
    - MUST respond to a PUBREL packet by sending a PUBCOMP packet containing the
      same Packet Identifier as the PUBREL.
    - After it has sent a PUBCOMP, the receiver MUST treat any subsequent
      PUBLISH packet that contains that Packet Identifier as being a new
      publication. *)
